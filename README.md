# OpenSCAD Bench

**A community driven benchmark for evaluating object design skills of LLMs in OpenSCAD.**

## The Insight

Real world experience shows significant quality gaps between LLMs when generating OpenSCAD code. The differentiating factor usually isn't syntax, most models handle that fine. The real challenge is **mechanical reasoning** or simply put, object design.

## How It Works

The repository is organized into **Challenges**. Each challenge represents a real-world problem (e.g., "design a headphone hook").

Inside each challenge, we track one-shot attempts by the different **Models**.

### Structure

```
/challenges
  /[challenge-name]
    README.md          # Success criteria and metadata
    prompt.md          # The exact prompt text
    reference.png      # Optional reference image
    /models
      /[model-name]
        attempt.scad   # The code generated by the model
        output.stl     # The rendered 3D model
```
