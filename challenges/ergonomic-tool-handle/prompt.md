Create an ergonomic tool handle grip based on the cross-section profiles shown in the reference sketch.

The handle is defined by 4 cross-sections that transition smoothly from base to tip:
- Section A (base): Rounded rectangle shape
- Section B: Elliptical shape  
- Section C: Circle with an asymmetric thumb rest bump
- Section D (tip): Simple circle

Requirements:
- Refer to the reference image for the exact cross-section shapes and dimensions
- Create smooth transitions between the sections (use hull between slices or similar technique)
- The thumb rest feature in section C must be present and correctly positioned
- Total handle length should be approximately 90mm
- The geometry must be manifold and suitable for 3D printing
