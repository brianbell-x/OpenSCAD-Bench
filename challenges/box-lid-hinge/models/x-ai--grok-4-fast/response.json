Each part has a 20mm x 20mm x 3mm mounting plate with two 3mm-diameter screw holes positioned at the center along the plate length (x=10mm for box, x=-10mm for lid) and at y=5mm and 15mm along the hinge length. The knuckles are 6mm outer diameter with 3.2mm inner holes for a 3mm filament pin. Print the two parts separately, slide the lid knuckle between the box knuckles, and insert a ~20mm length of 3mm filament (e.g., PLA infill or a metal pin) as the hinge pin. The design assumes assembly on the outer surface of the 3mm-thick box and lid edges. Adjust parameters if needed for your printer's tolerances."
