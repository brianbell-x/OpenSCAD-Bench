I need a hinge for a small box lid - the box walls are 3mm thick.

Requirements:
- Designed for 3mm thick walls.
- Should be print-in-place if possible, or a simple two-part assembly using a piece of filament as the pin.
- Needs mounting holes to attach to the box and lid (e.g., 3mm screw holes).
- Total width of the hinge should be around 20mm.
