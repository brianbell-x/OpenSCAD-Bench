Create a toroidal propeller with the following specifications:

## Design Requirements
- **Number of blades**: 3 blades arranged symmetrically (120° apart)
- **Central hub**: Cylindrical hub with a mounting hole
  - Hub outer diameter: 15mm
  - Hub height: 10mm
  - Mounting hole diameter: 5mm (through-hole)
- **Blade design**: Each blade is a wide, flat toroidal band/loop
  - Blade loop outer diameter: 50mm
  - Blade band width: 12mm (the height/width of the flat band)
  - Blade band thickness: 2mm (the wall thickness of the band)
  - Each blade forms a nearly complete loop (approximately 330-350° of arc)
  - Each blade is tilted/angled relative to the hub plane to create propeller pitch
  - Blades spiral upward approximately 15mm in height from where they connect to the hub
- **Overall diameter**: Approximately 100mm tip-to-tip

## Key Characteristics
- The blades are wide flat bands forming open loops, not thin tubular rings
- Each blade loop should be tilted/angled to create the propeller pitch (helical twist)
- The blades connect to the hub and sweep outward and upward in a smooth curve
- The design must be manifold (watertight) for 3D printing
- All three blades must be identical and symmetrically arranged
