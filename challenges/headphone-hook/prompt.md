Create a headphone hook that clamps onto a desk.

Requirements:
- The desk thickness is 25mm.
- The hook should extend about 50mm out from the desk.
- The part that holds the headphones should be curved to prevent creasing the headband.
- It should use a simple friction fit or a C-clamp shape (no screws required for this version).
- Wall thickness should be sturdy, at least 4mm.
